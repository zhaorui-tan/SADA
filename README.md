Our proofs are also included in this repo. Please enjoy it 


Using SADA is quite easy. The key is to get those conditional covariances, other steps are very simple.
We show some examples of how to apply them.
The codes include SADA applied to different backbones.
Note: Some codes are quite messy... now I just stack them here, and sorry for any inconvenience.
I am going to tide them up gradually (if someone asks :P) 

Here is a brief overview:
